# marketplace

A dynamic marketplace for multiple merchant types.

This webapp can be re-used by multiple merchants, as the title, logo, theme and products can be changed to fit a specific merchant, by simply adjusting a single config file.

All the configuration that is necessary to adjust when setting up a new merchant is within the config.dart file. Once the merchant is configured within this file, the site will update accordingly when that merchant is selected.

The ability to select a merchant from a list of merchants is only to demonstrate how the application updates when a different merchant is configured.
